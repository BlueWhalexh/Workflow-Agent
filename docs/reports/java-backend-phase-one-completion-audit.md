# Java Backend Phase One Completion Audit

> Current date: 2026-06-17. This audit is a goal-tracking artifact for `按照sop完成后端一期的开发`; it is not a completion claim.

## Current Goal

Complete backend phase one under the project SOP: central Java backend control plane for multiple users and workspaces, with stable API contracts, permission boundaries, async run/job control, artifact/approval/audit evidence, provider credential safety, and documented verification.

## Latest Gate Resolution

J29A: `Java Provider Secret Injection Baseline` is now implemented as an approved scope expansion.

Plan:

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-java-provider-secret-injection-baseline.md`

Scope that required approval:

- Adds a backend internal `ProviderSecretResolver` SPI for `secret://...` credential refs.
- Adds out-of-band `AgentWorkerSecretInjection` so raw secret values do not enter `AgentWorkerRequest`.
- Extends `AgentRunService` and `LocalTsAgentWorker` secret handling.
- Requires worker contract, service, tests, docs, and report updates.
- Touched more than five files.

SOP result:

- User approved the scope expansion.
- DB-backed credential refs can resolve `secret://...` through a backend resolver SPI when such a resolver is configured.
- The run path passes only `apiKeyEnvName = "PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_API_KEY"` in the worker request.
- Raw secret values move only through `AgentWorkerSecretInjection` and local worker process environment.
- Default workers reject non-empty secret injection unless they explicitly opt in.
- J29A is not a production secret manager. It does not implement KMS, Keychain/file adapters, secret rotation, public secret registration, remote runner secret distribution, or real provider execution.
- Verification evidence is archived in `docs/reports/runtime-work-item-execution-resume-delivery.md`.

## Recommended Phase Order

1. J25A: public workspace-scoped provider credential metadata API. Completed baseline.
   - Owner can upsert/list env-backed metadata.
   - Public response never returns env names, `apiKeySecretRef`, token, Authorization, raw provider payload, internal path, or server storage ref.
   - Existing J24E `providerRuntimeRef = "credential.<ref>"` remains the run consumption path.

2. J26A: credential lifecycle guard. Completed baseline.
   - Disable credential metadata without deleting audit history.
   - Preserve run behavior: disabled refs are not resolved.
   - Still no raw secret or secret manager lookup.

3. J27A: audit retention policy baseline. Completed baseline.
   - Configurable retention metadata and owner-visible policy.
   - No destructive purge until a separate explicit phase defines retention execution and audit export safeguards.

4. J28A: persisted signed audit record baseline. Completed baseline.
   - Persist signature/digest metadata at repository append time.
   - Keep existing J19A digest semantics stable while adding hash-chain metadata.

5. J29A: provider secret injection baseline. Completed baseline.
   - Resolve `secret://...` via backend SPI when configured.
   - Inject raw secret only through per-run worker environment for supporting local workers.
   - Still no external KMS, public secret registration, rotation, or remote runner distribution.

6. J30A: remote runner registration/lease design and baseline.
   - Registry, heartbeat, lease lifecycle, runner authz boundaries.
   - No runner-scoped secret distribution until a dedicated secret phase.

7. J31A+: identity hardening and directory lifecycle.
   - OIDC/OAuth integration plan.
   - User/team CRUD and role sync.

## Completion Criteria For Backend Phase One

Phase one should not be marked complete until all of the following are true and freshly verified:

- Public API surface required by the Java platform spec is implemented or explicitly descoped in the spec.
- Provider credential management has a public metadata API or a documented user-approved deferral.
- Secret handling does not accept raw provider tokens in JSON, logs, artifacts, DB plaintext, worker requests, or public responses.
- Run, approval, artifact, audit, and provider credential flows have focused tests and full Java suite evidence.
- TypeScript worker/SDK bridge compatibility has full `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` evidence.
- Delivery report includes RED/GREEN/full/static evidence for the latest completed phase.
- Architecture spec current-status line and relevant boundaries match the code.
- Token redaction scan has no real-token-shaped matches.
- Unchecked phase plan scan is clean only for completed phase plans; active gated plans may intentionally keep unchecked boxes.

## Current Decision Needed

No J29A approval is pending. The next implementation slice should be selected explicitly because remaining backend phase-one gaps still include public/security-sensitive areas such as external secret manager/KMS, production runner platform, identity hardening, and multi-node stream fanout.
